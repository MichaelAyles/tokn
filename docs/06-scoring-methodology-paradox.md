# The Scoring Methodology Paradox

**Date:** December 7, 2024

## The Question

Our benchmark uses **Gemini 2.5 Flash** (released June 2025) to evaluate circuit designs generated by **Claude Opus 4.5** (December 2025). This raises an uncomfortable question:

> How can an older, faster model properly evaluate the work of a newer, more capable one?

If Claude Opus 4.5 has deeper knowledge of electronics and IC pinouts, wouldn't it generate circuits that Gemini 2.5 Flash can't fully appreciate or might incorrectly penalize?

---

## Why We Use Gemini 2.5 Flash for Scoring

### 1. Cost Efficiency

| Model | Cost per 1M tokens | Cost to score 100 circuits |
|-------|-------------------|---------------------------|
| Gemini 2.5 Flash | ~$0.10 | ~$0.03 |
| Claude Opus 4.5 | ~$75.00 | ~$22.50 |

Using Claude to evaluate Claude would cost 750x more. At scale, this becomes prohibitive.

### 2. Speed

| Model | Time per evaluation |
|-------|-------------------|
| Gemini 2.5 Flash | ~2 seconds |
| Claude Opus 4.5 | ~40 seconds |

For rapid iteration during development, 2-second feedback loops are essential.

### 3. Consistency

Using the same scorer across all generators provides a fair baseline. If we used Claude to score Claude, we'd need Claude to score Qwen too, introducing potential bias toward similar reasoning patterns.

---

## The Validity Concern

Let's examine what the scorer actually evaluates:

### What Gemini CAN Judge Accurately

1. **Syntax validity** — Is the TOKN format correct?
2. **Component presence** — Are all requested ICs present?
3. **Connection topology** — Are components connected logically?
4. **Power integrity** — Are VCC/GND pins connected?
5. **Decoupling capacitors** — Present or absent?
6. **Net naming conventions** — Descriptive or generic?

These are **objective, verifiable checks** that don't require cutting-edge knowledge.

### What Gemini MIGHT Misjudge

1. **Exact pin assignments** — Is pin 7 really VCC on this obscure IC?
2. **Optimal component values** — Is 10kΩ better than 4.7kΩ here?
3. **Advanced design patterns** — Novel circuit topologies
4. **Subtle correctness issues** — Edge cases in IC behavior

## Evidence from Our Benchmarks

Looking at our results, we can test whether the scoring is biased:

### Claude's Score Distribution

| Category | Claude Opus 4.5 | Qwen 3 235B |
|----------|-----------------|-------------|
| Functionality | 68.3 | 59.3 |
| Completeness | 57.3 | 48.3 |
| Correctness | 50.3 | 39.5 |
| Best Practices | 54.0 | 45.7 |

Claude scores higher across all categories. If Gemini were "missing" Claude's advanced knowledge, we'd expect:
- Claude's correctness score to be artificially low
- Penalties for valid but uncommon approaches

Instead, Claude leads significantly in **correctness** (50.3 vs 39.5) — the category most dependent on domain knowledge. This suggests Gemini IS recognizing Claude's superior IC knowledge.

### The Hard Prompt Test

On hard prompts (4+ IC systems), Claude scored **58.6** while other models dropped to **25-47**. This gap widening on complex circuits indicates Gemini can distinguish quality even on sophisticated designs.

## The Philosophical Argument

### "A Student Can Grade a Test"

Consider: a teaching assistant with a 1st-class degree can grade PhD-level exam papers — if they have the answer key. The TA doesn't need to independently discover the answers; they need to verify against known criteria.

Similarly, Gemini doesn't need to *invent* circuit designs. It needs to:
1. Parse the TOKN structure
2. Check against the prompt requirements
3. Verify well-known IC conventions
4. Apply standard design rules

Most electronics knowledge is *documented*, not *invented*. A 555 timer's pinout is in every datasheet. Gemini has access to this knowledge even if it can't creatively apply it as well as Claude.

### The Creativity Gap

Where this analogy breaks down: what if Claude generates a *novel but valid* approach that Gemini doesn't recognize?

This is a legitimate concern, but our scoring categories mitigate it:
- **Functionality (35%)** — Does it work? Gemini can reason about this.
- **Completeness (25%)** — Are components present? Objective check.
- **Correctness (25%)** — Pin assignments. Documented knowledge.
- **Best Practices (15%)** — Conventions. Well-established.

Only 15-25% of the score touches subjective design quality where a knowledge gap might matter.

## Alternatives Considered

### 1. Self-Evaluation (Claude Scores Claude)

**Problems:**
- 750x cost increase
- Potential bias toward own reasoning patterns
- Still imperfect — models can't perfectly evaluate themselves

### 2. Human Expert Scoring

**Problems:**
- Doesn't scale (we scored 195 circuits)
- Inter-rater reliability issues
- Expensive and slow

### 3. Simulation-Based Validation

**Problems:**
- TOKN doesn't include values for full SPICE simulation
- Would require building actual circuits (impractical)
- Some circuits (microcontrollers) can't be meaningfully simulated

### 4. Use Multiple Scorers and Average

**Potential approach:**
- Score with Gemini, Claude, and GPT-4
- Average results to reduce individual model bias
- Still expensive, but more robust

## Proposed Improvements

### Short Term: Spot-Check Validation

For each benchmark run:
1. Randomly sample 5 circuits
2. Have Claude Opus 4.5 re-score them
3. Compare to Gemini scores
4. Flag significant discrepancies (>15 points)

This provides a sanity check without scoring everything twice.

### Medium Term: Rubric-Based Scoring

Create explicit rubrics for each scoring category:
- Pin 14 of 74HC00 must connect to VCC: +5 points
- Each IC must have decoupling cap: +3 points
- Net names must be descriptive: +2 points

More mechanical scoring reduces scorer judgment and levels the playing field.

### Long Term: Hybrid Approach

1. Use Gemini for initial screening (fast, cheap)
2. Escalate borderline cases (45-55 range) to Claude for re-evaluation
3. Only use expensive scoring where it matters

## Conclusion

Using Gemini 2.5 Flash to score Claude Opus 4.5 is **pragmatic, not perfect**.

**The case for validity:**
- Most checks are objective (syntax, component presence, power connections)
- Claude leads in correctness — Gemini IS recognizing better designs
- The gap widens on hard prompts — discrimination power is maintained
- Domain knowledge is mostly documented, not invented

**The acknowledged limitations:**
- Novel approaches might be undervalued
- Subtle correctness issues might be missed
- A 50.3/100 correctness score might actually be 60/100 with a smarter scorer

**Our approach:**
We use Gemini because it's practical and provides consistent, comparable baselines. We acknowledge it's an approximation. For production use where absolute quality matters, human review or multi-model consensus scoring is recommended.

The fundamental insight: **relative rankings are likely correct** even if absolute scores are imprecise. Claude Opus 4.5 scoring 18% higher than Qwen 3 235B is meaningful, even if both scores would shift with a different scorer.

## Meta-Commentary

This document itself demonstrates the paradox: I (Claude Opus 4.5) am analyzing whether a simpler model can evaluate my work. There's an inherent conflict of interest.

But that's also the point — I can articulate concerns that Gemini might miss, which is precisely why this analysis is valuable. The solution isn't to abandon practical scoring methods, but to understand their limitations and design around them.
