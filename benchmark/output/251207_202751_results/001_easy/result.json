    "The circuit is missing an active component (e.g., an inverter, op-amp, or dedicated oscillator IC) to create the oscillation. A crystal and two capacitors alone cannot oscillate.",
    "The crystal Y1 has only two pins, but the nets section implies it has two distinct connection points (Y1.1 and Y1.2) which is correct for a 2-pin crystal. However, the wires section shows '100 100' for both XTAL_OSC1 and XTAL_OSC2, which is the crystal's center point, not its pins.",
    "The nets 'XTAL_OSC1' and 'XTAL_OSC2' are connected to the crystal, but there's no output or input for the oscillator, making it non-functional even if it could oscillate.",
    "The 'GND' net connects C1.2 and C2.2, which is correct for a Pierce oscillator configuration, but without an active component, this connection is insufficient.",
    "The component 'Y1' is defined with width and height as 0,0 which is unusual for a component symbol, though not critical for electrical function."
  ],
  "ai_suggestions": [
    "Add an active component such as a 74HC04 inverter (or similar logic gate configured as an inverter) or a dedicated crystal oscillator IC to form a Pierce oscillator or other suitable oscillator circuit.",
    "If using an inverter, include a feedback resistor (e.g., 1M Ohm) and a series resistor (e.g., 330 Ohm) for proper operation.",
    "Ensure power and ground connections are provided to the active component.",
    "Clearly define the input and output of the oscillator circuit."
  ],
  "ai_explanation": "The provided circuit is fundamentally incomplete and non-functional. A crystal and two capacitors alone cannot generate an oscillation; an active component (like an inverter or dedicated oscillator IC) is required to provide gain and feedback. Without this, the circuit will not oscillate as requested.",
